# Power BI DAX Queries
Welcome to the Power BI DAX Query Examples repository! 

This repository provides sample Power BI reports demonstrating DAX Queries and highlights the examples covered in the accompanying blog post on [EthanGuyant.com](ethanguyant.com). These examples focus on leveraging DAX queries to explore, validate, and optimize data models effectively.

Get hands-on with DAX Queries in Power BI, experiment, and explore your data models with ease.

## üìÇ What's Inside the Repository
The repository includes:

1) `dax-query-view.pbix`: This Power BI report comes pre-loaded with sample data and provides an overview of DAX Query View discussed in the [Dive into DAX: Getting Started with DAX Query View] blog post.
2) `sample-data.xlsx`: Get the sample dataset used in the report and create your own Power BI report from scratch, giving you the freedom to analyze the data with DAX Queries in your own unique way.
